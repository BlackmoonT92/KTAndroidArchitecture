# KTAndroidArchitecture
A kotlint android architecture with Google Architecture Components
## 1. A Brief Introduciton
The app is a sample project that shows how to implement the KTAndroidArchitecture into your Android app.

### 1.1 What is KTAndroidArchitecture?
It is a layer-based architecture that allows a real disentangle of the UI components from the business logic.

The main components are:

* UI
* UIModel
* ViewModels with Livedata
* UseCase
* Repository

### 1.2 KTAndroidArchitecture main components

#### 1.2.1 UI

The UI layer of the architecture comprises activities, fragments and views. 

#### 1.2.2 UIModel

A **UIModel** is a object which contains all UI-related datas of a view, a fragment or an activity

#### 1.2.3 ViewModels with Livedata

Each activity or fragment could have a **ViewModel** which is a object designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way by defining some **Actions** to call one or more **UseCases**

#### 1.2.4 UseCase
A **UseCase** is a wrapper for a small business logic operation. A **UseCase** can use one or more **Repository** to get or write the requested data, then it returns the response event.

#### 1.2.5 Repository
A **Repository** handles the process of saving or retrieving data from a datasource, it is managed by one or more **UseCase**.

#### 1.2.6 Action
An **Action** handles the process of calling a **UseCase** and map the response, generally an action use only one **UseCase** but is possible to define an ActionQueue to call multiple **UseCases** sequentially.

## 2. How to use it?

### 2.1 Import dependency

### 2.2 Create a Repository
A repository needs just to extend **BaseRepository** in this way 
```kotlin
  class AuthRepository:BaseRepository() 
```

### 2.3 Create a UseCase
A usecase has to extend **UseCase<Out,In>** and implement a method run
```kotlin
class LoginUseCase: UseCase<UserLogged, LoginActionParams>() {
    override suspend fun run(params: LoginActionParams): Either<Failure, UserLogged> {
        do something
        return result
    }
}
```
The run function defined inside the UseCase can return a **Failure object** or a **Model object**.

The input params are defined in a Param object which is a data class defined like this
```kotlin
data class LoginActionParams(val email: String, val password: String) : ActionParams()
```

### 2.4 Create a ViewModel for your Activity/Fragment

A ViewModel needs to extend an abstract class BaseViewModel 
```kotlin
class LoginViewModel: BaseViewModel()
```
#### 2.4.1 Define an Action inside the ViewModel
An **Action** can be created by using a Builder like this
```kotlin
val actionLogin = Action.Builder<ActionParams,Model,UiModel>()
            .useCase(LoginUseCase::class.java)
            .buildWithUiModel { it }
```

### 2.5 Call the Action from the Activity/Fragment
An action has several methods like:
- ``` action?.observe(...) ```, this method observe the success of the operation defined inside the usecase;
- ``` action?.observeFailure(...) ```, this method observe the failure of the operation; 
- ``` action?.observeLoadingStatus(...) ```, this method observe the loading state of the operation; 
- ``` action?.execute(...) ```, this method call the run function inside the usecase and execute the operation;

To call an action you have to write this√π
```kotlin
        viewModel?.action?.observe(this, ::onActionSuccess)
        viewModel?.action?.observeFailure(this, ::onActionFailed)
        viewModel?.action?.execute(Params)
```
